# X-mas Rush Post Mortem

This contest was a lot of fun for me. Also very intense because of the close fight between number 1 and number 2. I ended at rank 2, which is a personal record for me. Very happy with the result. In this post mortem I will try to explain the main things I think I did right and also the things that didn't work for me.

## Simulation

This contest was hard for beginners to get into. This is mainly because of the necessity of a push simulation. Push is complex in that you need to take into account pushes by both players on 7 possible different rows and columns. The difficulty depends greatly on your choice of board representation. I decided to go with a "bitboard"
